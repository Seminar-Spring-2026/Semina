# Project Name

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
* How might we use AI to protect small public water systems without requiring IT staff or cloud access?
* How might we bring AI-powered anomaly detection to rural infrastructure where connectivity is limited and stakes are high?
* How might we make AI cybersecurity accessible to small communities?

## Project Description 🤯
Sentra is an AI-powered anomaly detection platform designed to protect small public water systems from cyber threats. It runs locally on edge devices, fusing OT and IT telemetry to detect suspicious behavior — even in low-connectivity environments. With grant-aligned pricing, plug-and-play setup, and out-of-band alerting, Sentra empowers rural operators to respond to risks without needing a cybersecurity team.

## Project Value 💰
Sentra’s target customers are small public water systems — especially those in rural or underserved communities with limited IT staff and aging infrastructure. These operators often lack the resources to implement traditional cybersecurity solutions, leaving them vulnerable to service disruptions and costly post-attack recovery. Sentra delivers tangible benefits by providing AI-powered anomaly detection, real-time alerts, and public dashboards that run locally on edge devices — all with grant-aligned pricing and zero need for cloud access or cybersecurity expertise.
